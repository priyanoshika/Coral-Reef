MLP Classifier for Safeguarding Coral Reefs

Overview
This project is a machine learning initiative aimed at forecasting and mitigating ecological stress on coral reef ecosystems. Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, the goal is to predict environmental threats and identify their primary causes, enabling proactive conservation efforts.

Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Developed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to forecast ecological stress with high accuracy.

High Accuracy: The model achieved a classification accuracy of 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness even with an unequal class distribution.

Feature Analysis: Identified 9 critical features influencing coral reef health.

Causal Insight: Used permutation importance analysis to identify commercial activities as a primary environmental stressor contributing to coral bleaching.

Web-Based Interface: Implemented a web-based interface using Flask for real-time assessments and accessibility.

Technologies & Libraries
Programming Language: Python

Core Libraries:

NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.

Scikit-Learn for the MLP classifier and other machine learning tools.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Flask for the web application.
