Developed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to forecast and mitigate ecological stress
on coral reef ecosystems, focusing on eight critical features.
Achieved a high classification accuracy of 97%, confirmed by metrics such as precision,
recall, and F1-score, even with an unequal class distribution.
Identified commercial activities as a primary environmental stressor contributing to coral
bleaching using permutation importance analysis, and implemented a web-based interface
using Flask for real-time assessments and conservation efforts.
